Hi, I'm André. I'm a software developer based in Europe. A bit about me:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Worked with various platforms and technologies</li>
    <li>
        Full-stack -- UI/UX, accessibility, functionality, security,
        infrastructure, performance, among other things
    </li>
    <li>Open-source project contributor</li>
</ul>
Beyond what's tech-centric, my hobbies include travel, photography, and music.
<br />
<br />
Any questions, ideas, or just want to say hi? Feel free to get in touch.
