Hi, I'm Andr√©. I'm a software developer based in Europe. A bit about me:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Worked with various platforms and technologies</li>
    <li>Full-stack -- UI/UX, accessibility, functionality, security, infrastructure, performance, among other things</li>
    <li>Contributor to open source projects</li>
</ul>
The "technologies" section below will get into more detail of the sort of things I work with.
<br>
<br>
Beyond what's tech-centric, hobbies include travel, photography, and music.
<br>
<br>
Any questions, ideas, or just want to say hi? Feel free to get in touch.
