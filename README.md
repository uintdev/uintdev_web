# uintdev web

This is the source code of a JavaScript application behind bundling assets for the website [uint.dev](https://uint.dev/).

This website is hosted using Cloudflare Workers.

## Setup

### CLI

This mainly uses the Bun runtime. Node.js has to still be installed due to Webpack being hardcoded to use it.
In the case of Cloudflare Workers, it offers a Node compatibility layer that effectively acts like Node.js down to the name.

```bash
bun run build
```

### Web server

For the web server of your choice, point the document root for the virtual host to the `dist/` directory (or its results) that was created from the build process.
